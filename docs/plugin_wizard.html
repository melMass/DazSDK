What is the DAZ Studio Plug-in Wizard?</h2>
<p>The DAZ Studio Plug-in Wizard is a custom application wizard for Microsoft&reg; Visual Studio. The user can quickly and easily create the basic framework of several common DAZ Studio plug-in types. This allows the focus to be given to development of the plug-in right from the start, instead of spending time on repetitive preparation.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="dspw_using"></a>
Using the Plug-in Wizard</h2>
<p>Once the DAZ Studio Plug-in Wizard is installed it is accessible from within the New Project dialog of Microsoft® Visual Studio. In the Project Type pane on the left, expand the Visual C++ section and select <b>DAZ</b>. In the Templates pane on the right, select <b>DAZ Studio Plug-in</b>. After the project template has been selected, enter the name of the project into the text field below the two panes, as well as selecting the location the project should be created in. OK can then be clicked to continue to the plug-in wizard. A screenshot of the new project dialog with the appropriate items selected follows:</p>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p>When the DAZ Studio Plug-in wizard dialog appears only a few simple tasks must be completed before the new plug-in project is created. The first is selecting the type of basic plug-in template to be used for the project. The second is filling in the necessary data fields. The differences between these types and fields will be explained in the following sections.</p>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="dspw_basetype"></a>
Base Plug-in Type</h2>
<p>The vast majority of DAZ Studio plug-ins provide some kind of 'Action' behavior within the application. Most often this is adding a new menu item or button to the interface as a means of activating the plug-in. As such, the plug-in wizard will generate the basic source files, including classes, for the most common action types. There is also the option of generating an empty plug-in project that contains only the barest essentials for developing a DAZ Studio plug-in. Each of the action types are explained below:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Generic:</b> This plug-in type can be used to implement an action class that does not automatically appear in a menu and can be accessed via a custom interface. </li>
<li>
<b>Create Item:</b> This plug-in type can be used to implement an action class that automatically appears under the <b>Create</b> menu. </li>
<li>
<b>Edit:</b> This plug-in type can be used to implement an action that automatically appears under the <b>Edit</b> menu. </li>
<li>
<b>Pane:</b> This plug-in type can be used to implement an action that automatically appears under the <b>View &gt; Tabs</b> menu. </li>
<li>
<b>Save Filter:</b> This plug-in type can be used to implement an action that automatically appears under the <b>File &gt; Save As</b> menu. </li>
<li>
<b>Shader Mixer Brick:</b> This plug-in type can be used to implement a new Shader Mixer brick that appears in the 'Shader Mixer' pane as an available brick type. </li>
<li>
<b>View Tool:</b> This plug-in type can be used to implement an action that automatically appears under the <b>Tools</b> menu. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="dspw_datafields"></a>
Data Fields</h2>
<p>Within every DAZ Studio plug-in there are three pieces of information that should always be known. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Author Name:</b> This is the name of the plug-in author. It will be displayed to users in the <b>Help &gt; About Installed Plug-ins</b> dialog for DAZ Studio. </li>
<li>
<b>Display Name:</b> This is the name of the plug-in itself. It will be displayed to users in the <b>Help &gt; About Installed Plug-ins</b> dialog for DAZ Studio, as well as be used for the action name added to the appropriate menu for the plug-in. It should be something meaningful with respect to the purpose of the plug-in. </li>
<li>
<b>Main Class Name:</b> This is the name of the main class of the plug-in used within the source code. It will be used in the generation of the basic source code for the plug-in project. It should be meaningful with respect to the plug-in and its purpose. It can be named using spaces and/or underscores to separate the individual ‘words’. For example: My_Studio_Class_Pane </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="dspw_activationpolicies"></a>
Activation Policies</h2>
<p>Each DAZ Studio plug-in can be configured to provide an evaluation period or require a valid, unique, serial number to be enabled, by use of activation policies. The current built-in activation policies provided by DAZ Studio are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>No activation policy:</b> This option provides no activation policy for the DAZ Studio plug-in, which will always be enabled. </li>
<li>
<b>No Evaluation:</b> This activation policy provides no evaluation period for the DAZ Studio plug-in, but requires a valid serial number for the plug-in to be enabled. </li>
<li>
<b>Expiration Date:</b> This activation policy provides an evaluation period that expires on the specified date. The DAZ Studio plug-in will be disabled after the expiration date unless a valid serial number for the plug-in is entered. </li>
<li>
<b>Trial Days:</b> This activation policy provides an evaluation period that ends after the number of specified days. The DAZ Studio plug-in will be disabled after the number of trial days unless a valid serial number for the plug-in is entered. </li>
</ul>
<p>More information about how to use activation policies see <a class="el" href="pluginreg.html">DAZ Studio Plug-in Activation and Serialization</a>.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="dspw_developing"></a>
Developing Your Plug-in</h2>
<p>After the plug-in project has been created it will compile and run in DAZ Studio. However, before beginning to add new code to the plug-in, a moment should be taken to fill in the plug-in description text and version in the <em>pluginname</em>.cpp file using the <a class="el" href="pluginmacros.html#dz_plugin_version">DZ_PLUGIN_VERSION()</a> and <a class="el" href="pluginmacros.html#dz_plugin_description">DZ_PLUGIN_DESCRIPTION()</a> macros.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="dspw_configuration"></a>
Configuration</h2>
<p>All necessary configuration of the plug-in wizard is done by the installer. However, if the installation location of the DAZ Studio SDK is ever changed the DAZ_STUDIO_SDK system environment variable must be changed to match the new installation location, including the sdk directory itself. </p>
